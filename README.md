This is the personal website of Louis Christopher, hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). You can find it at [louischristopher.me](http://louischristopher.me).

The site uses a minimal jekyll theme, called [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). This design might or might not change in the future depending on my how well my front-end skills improve.
