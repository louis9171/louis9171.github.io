I've decided to start writing a blog as a way to document my journey and help me stay focused. It will also better my writing skills. My research skills will improve because I will have to fact check everything I post. Proof read also. Do feel free to comment below using disqus.
My posts will probably deal with  Programming, Linux and some handy instructions or gotchaâ€™s which I find useful. My posts will not be limited to technical topics though, I also plan to share my thoughts of the world around me.

I have had blogs before but I've never actively maintained any of them. As I write this post I'm in the process of figuring out how to delete my long since abandoned wordpress and blogger accounts. Unfortunately blogger does <em>not</em> allow you delete your profile without also deleting your google account.

I will be writing at least one post per week which in my opinion is an easier schedule to stick to than [Jeff Atwood's](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/){:target="_blank"} six posts per week.

#### How I set up my blog

I followed Joshua Lande's excellent [post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) on how to set up a fully functioning blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted for free using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I can't recommend Jekyll enough, it's fast, simple, elegant and most importantly all posts are written in markdown. If you've never heard of it before, check this [quora post](https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-static-site-generator-like-Jekyll-work). What I like most is the github integration, I can easily roll back any changes I made to the site. Here's the [repository](https://github.com/louis9171/louis9171.github.io) if you're interested.

I use [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) along with [sublime-jekyll](http://23maverick23.github.io/sublime-jekyll/) to ease my Jekyll workflow. I use [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for the domain registration and if you're a student you can grab one for free through Github's [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), they offer a lot of other free stuff too! To support https on a custom domain I used Cloudflare, instructions can be found [here](https://konklone.com/post/github-pages-now-sorta-supports-https-so-use-it). Github has not been very helpful to provide support for [this](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156) on their end.
