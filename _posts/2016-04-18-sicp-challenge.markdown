I have decided to take on task of actually <em>doing</em> [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Science](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs). I have tried reading it in the past with varying degrees of success. Just reading the book isn't enough though. The authors have really put in a lot of effort in structuring the exercises. If you skip them, you'll be missing out on a huge part of what makes SICP so wonderful. You can find the book freely available with search friendly modern typography [here](https://github.com/sarabander) .

## Why am I doing it?

You will find a lot of claims about this book on the internet ranging from horrid to magical. I'm not kidding, check any reddit or Hacker News thread, you'll find people either praising this book or hating on it. Peter Norvig's [review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262510871&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books){:target="_blank"} of the book on Amamzon sheds some light on why this is so.

I want to read SICP because functional programming fascinates me. It forces me to think in ways I'd never have imagined in a heavily Object Oriented language. I love how elegantly designed Lisp is in John McCarthy's original paper. Here's an excellent [summary](http://swizec.com/blog/the-birth-of-lisp-a-summary-of-john-mccarthys-original-paper/swizec/5075) of it without being too dificult to understand. Most languages today are adopting at least some of the ideas found in the functional world, anonymous/lambda functions being the most copied feature of late. Even Java has them now with the release of Java 8. If you haven't heard of Lisp before, I recommend reading this [post](http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html) by Paul Graham, it may be long but it's worth it. I've shamelessly become a proponent of any functional language I come across.

## Goals

* <em>Read the book alongside watching the original SICP lectures</em> by Abelson and Sussman available [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) and on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090).

* <em>Complete 95% of the exercises.</em> Some of the exercises are such that a solution is worthy of a Ph.D. thesis.[^fn-footnote] There are 356 exercises in SICP, so I need to average one a day, I should be done in one year.

The project will be publicly available on github at this [repo](https://github.com/louis9171/Scheme_SICP) it's so that I can easily track my progress and  to help me stick to my schedule. Here's to the future. 

[^fn-footnote]: Soemwhere in the beginning of the book is a problem where the authors themselves don't have an answer for. Can't seem to find it now.
