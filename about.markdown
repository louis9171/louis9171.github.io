Update 2020: I started this blog when I was a student so that I could document my progress as a developer.
More to come soon.

### Major areas of interest

- Functional Programming and Programming Language Theory
- Building Distributed Systems with Go
- DevOps
- React/React Native/RxJS

I firmly believe in Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) philosophy.
Currently working on the [SICP Challenge](https://louischristopher.me/sicp-challenge).
