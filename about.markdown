I am Louis Christopher. I started this blog so that I can document my own progress as a student developer.

### Major areas of interest

* Functional Programming and Programming Language Theory
* Dynamically typed languages especially Python and JavaScript
* React/React Native and Node.js
* DevOps and Backend Development
* Machine Learning

This list is very likely to expand and only reflects what I'm currently working on.

### Achievements

* Won a hackathon conducted by Microsoft [in 2015](https://i.imgur.com/BbFS9pS.jpg)

I firmly believe in Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) philosophy.
Currently working on the [SICP Challenge](https://louischristopher.me/sicp-challenge).
